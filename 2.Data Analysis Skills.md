Data Analysis Essential Skills are:

  **1. Curiosity:**
       Wanting to learn something, curiosity seek out new challenges and experiences which leads to knowledge. 
        
  **2. Understanding context:**
       Context is the condition in which something exists or happens.
        
  **3. Having technical mindset:**
       The ability to break things down into smaller steps or pieces and work with them in an orderly and logical way.
  
  **4. Data design:**
       Part of Analytical skill set, Data design is how we organize information.
  
  **5. Data strategy:**
       Is also part of Analytical skill set, Data strategy is the management of the people, processes and tools used in data analysis.
        
**Analytical thinking:** 
Analytical thinking involves identifying and defining a problem and then solving it by using data in an organized, step-by-step manner.

*So as Data Analyst how to think Analytically?*
  Five key aspects to Analytical thinking are:
   
**1. Visualization:**
In Data analytics *Visualization* is the graphical representation of information. Visualization is important because visuals can help data analysts understand and explain information more effectively.
     
**2. Strategy:**
Being strategic with so much data available having a strategic mindset is key to staying focused and on track. Strategizing helps data analysts see what they want to achieve with the data and how they can get there strategy also helps improve the quality and usefulness of the data we collect. By strategizing we know all our data is valuable and can help us accomplish our goals.
     
**3. Problem Orientation:**
Data analysts use a problem-oriented approach in order to identify describe and solve problems. it's all about keeping the problem top of mind throughout the entire project.
     
**4. Correlation:**
Being able to identify a correlation between two or more pieces of data. A correlation is like a relationship, you can find all kinds of correlations in data, like it's the correlation between a rainier season leading to a high number of umbrellas being sold. 
But as we start identifying correlations and data, there's one thing we always want to keep in mind correlation does not equal causation. In other words just because two pieces
of data are both trending in the same direction that doesn't necessarily mean they are all related.

**5. Big picture and detail-oriented thinking:**
Being able to see the big picture as well as the details,a jigsaw puzzle is a great way to think about this. Big picture thinking is like looking at a complete puzzle we
can enjoy the whole picture without getting stuck on every tiny piece that went into making it. If we only focus on individual pieces we wouldn't be able to see past that which is why big picture thinking is so important. it helps us zoom out and see possibilities and opportunities this leads to exciting new ideas or innovations.
On the flip side detail-oriented thinking is all about figuring out all of the aspects that will help you execute a plan in other words the pieces that make up your puzzle, there are all kinds of problems in the business world that can benefit from employees who have both a big picture and a detail-oriented way of thinking.

It important to think in different ways, well because in data analysis solutions are almost never right in front of us. We need to think critically to find out the right questions to ask but we also need to think creatively to get new and unexpected answers. 

**Some of the questions Data Analysts ask when they're on the hunt for a solution:**
 
**1.What is the root cause of th problem?**: A root cause is the reason why a problem occurs. if we can identify and get rid of a root cause we can prevent that problem from happening again. A simple way to wrap your head around root causes is with the process called the *five whys* in the five wise we ask *why five times* to reveal the root cause the fifth and final answer should give us some useful and sometimes surprising insights.

   **Example:** let's say we wanted to make a blueberry pie but couldn't find any blueberries we'd be trying to solve a problem by asking *why can't i make a blueberry pie.*
   The answer would be:
   + Why 1 - There are no blueberries at the store.
   + Why 2 - Then ask why were there no blueberries at the store and discover that the blueberry bushes don't have enough fruit this season.
   + Why 3 - why was there not enough fruit this would lead to the fact that birds were eating all the berries.
   + Why 4 - The answer would be that, although the birds normally prefer mulberries and don't eat blueberries, the mulberry bushes didn't produce fruit this season.so the birds are eating blueberries instead.
   + Why 5 - And finally reveal the root cause, a late frost damaged the mulberry bushes so they didn't produce any fruit. so we can't make a blueberry pie because of a late frost months ago.

This how the five why's can reveal some very surprising root causes. This is a great trick to know and it can be a very helpful process in *Data analysis*.

**2.Commonly asked by data analysts is," Where are the gaps in our process?"**: People use 'Gap Analysis' to answer this question. 
*Gap Analysis* is a method of examining and evaluating how a process works currently in order to get where we want to be in future. The common approach to gap analysis is understanding where we are now compared to where we want to be, then we can identify the gaps that exist between a current and future state and determine how to bridge them.

**3. Data analysts ask a lot is, "What did we not consider before?"**: This is a great way to think about what information or procedure might be missing from a process. So we can identify ways to make better decisions and strategies moving forward.

Whole lot more the way data analysts think and ask questions plays a big part in how businesses make decisions, that's why analytical thinking and understanding how to ask the right questions can have such a huge impact on the overall success of a business.

**How Data-driven decisions, can lead to successful outcomes?:**
We might remember that data-driven decision-making involves using facts to guide business strategy.
Data analysts can tap into the power of data to do all kinds of amazing things with data, such as they can gain valuable insights, verify their theories or assumptions, better understand opportunities and challenges, support an objective, help make a plan and much more. In business data-driven decision-making, can improve the results in a lot of different ways. 16:54
