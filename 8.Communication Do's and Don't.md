**Stakeholders: **

Stakeholders play important role with Data Analysts. Stakeholders are people that have invested time, interest and resources into the projects that we'll be working on as a data analyst. In other words they hold stakes in what we're doing, there's a good chance they'll need the work from us to perform their own needs that's why it's so important to makesure our work lines up with their needs and why we need to communicate effectively with all of the stakeholders across the team. 

Project Managers are in charge of planning and executing a project, part of the project manager's job is keeping the project on track and look after the progress of the entire team. In most cases we'll need to give them regular updates, let them know what we need to succeed and tell them if we have any problems along the way, we might also be working with other team members. 

Our fellow data analysts will need all our focus and communication to carry the project to success. Focusing on stakeholder expectations will help us understand the goal of a project. Should Communicate more effectively across our team and build trust in our work. 

**Focus on what matters:**

By asking ourself a few simple questions at the beginning of each task we can ensure that we're able to stay focused on our objective while still balancing stakeholder needs. 

As a data analyst we could be working on multiple projects with lots of different people but no matter what project we're working on there are three things we can focus on which will help us stay on task:
  1. Who are the primary and secondary stakeholders?
  2. Who is managing data?
  3. Where we can go for help?
  
**1. Who are the primary and secondary stakeholders?**
   The primary stakeholder is probably the vice president who's hoping to use the project's findings to make new decisions about company policy. We'd also be giving updates to  our secondary stakeholders like project manager, team members or other data analysts who are depending on our work for their own task. We should always take time at the beginning of every project to identify our stakeholders and their goals then see who else is on our team and what their roles are.
   
**2. Who is managing data?**
  Think about working with other analysts on the project we're all data analysts but we may manage different data within our project. We should be able to communicate our objectives with another data analyst and use existing work to make our analysis richer by understanding who's managing the data we can spend our time more productively.
  
 **3. Where we can go for help?**(8.21)
  This is something we should know at the beginning of any project we work on. if we run into bumps in the road on our way to completing a task, we need someone who is best positioned to take down those barriers for us. When we know who's able to help, we'll spend less time worrying about other aspects of the project and more time focused on the objective.
