Problem solving and some of the common types of business problems that data analysts help solve and the 'ask' phase will help to craft effective questions to help us collect the right data to solve those problems.

**Asking effective questions using data in Problem Solving:**

Always think of problem as opportunities to show our skills to find creative and insightful solutions. Every problem, inspite of their complexities they need different approach to solve them but first step is same to all problem that is understanding the kind of it. 
Data analysts work with 6 basic problem types:

+ Making predictions: Using data, the company should visualize what would happen if anything done in unusual style. No one can see the future but data will help to make an informed decision.

+ Categorizing things: Data Analysts should categorize the things the problems that involves it to solve the issue.

+ Spotting something unusual: Some of us have a smart watch with app for health tracking which will help people stay healthy by collecting data such as their heart rate, sleep patterns, exercise routine and much more. There are many stories out there about health apps actually saving people's lives by giving notification on unusual like spike in heart rate than normal and so on.
 
+ Identifying themes: More useful in user experience field which is study and work to improve the interactions people have with products they use every day like apps, websites and even coffee makers. The process here is kind of like finding categories for the keywords and phrases in customer service conversations but identifying themes goes even further by grouping each insight into a broader theme then the designer can pinpoint the themes that are most common.

+ Discovering Connections: Case like transportation industry or third party logistics partners help businesses ship products when they don't have their own trucks, planes or ships. A common problem these partners face is figuring out how to reduce wait time. Wait time happens when a truck driver from a third party logistics provider arrives to pick
up shipment but it's not ready. so provider has to wait, that costs both company time and money and it stops the trucks from getting back on the road to make more deliveries.
so we can solve this well by sharing data. The partner companies can view each other's timelines and see what's causing shipments to run late. 

+ Finding patterns:  Data analysts can stop machines from breakdown in Oil and Gas companies by looking at patterns in the company's historical data by investigationg pattern
how and when a particular machine broke down in the past.


**Data Analyst should ask effective questions:**

As a Data Analyst, the more questions we ask the more we learn about data. Data Analyst should always make sure to ask a leading question which leads to answer in a certain way and avoid asking too vague and inappropriate questions, afterall the Data analysis process starts with ASK phase. So it's important that we ask the right questions, effective questions follow the **SMART** methodology like **S**pecific, **M**easurable, **A**ction oriented, **R**elevant and **T**ime bound.

+ **Specific** questions are simple, important and focused on a single topic or a few closely related ideas. This helps us collect information that's relevant to what we're investigating. Instead of generalize the question, try to narrow down by just focusing on one element.

+ **Measurable** questions can be quantified and assessed which allow to count and to know concrete number.

+ **Action-oriented** questions encourage change. These questions helps to solve problem by seeing the current state and figuring out way to transform it into the ideal future state.

+ **Relevant** questions matter are important and have significance to the problem we're trying to solve. 

+ **Time-bound** questions specify the time to be studied, the range of possibilities and enables the data analysts to focus on relevant data. 

**Fairness** should also considered while crafting the questions means ensuring that our questions sense to everyone with clear and straightforward wording that anyone can easily understand.
