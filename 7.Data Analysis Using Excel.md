**Spreadsheets(Excel)** are a powerful and flexible tool, which is why they're a big part of pretty much everything we do as data analysts. There's a good chance, a spreadsheet will be the first tool we reach for when trying to answer data-driven questions. Using spreadsheets, math is a core part of every data analyst but not every one enjoys it. Luckily spreadsheets can make calculations more enjoyable and by that I mean easier. Spreadsheets can do both basic and complex calculations .

Here's a quick look at some of the functions that we'll use when performing calculations, Sum, Average, Count, Min and Max are many functions can be used as part of a math formula as well. Data analysts spend a lot of time organizing data and performing calculations.

Some of the ways data analysts use spreadsheets to help them with their day-to-day responsibilities:
+  Organizing data with the task we've been given. Ex: Pivot table(Sort and filter).
+  Calculate data to learn more about it. Eg: Formulas and functions.

**Spreadsheet Basics:**
  + Formulas: A set of instructions that perform a specific calculation. They not only do math but use them throughout the data analysis processes. Formulas built on operators. Operators which are symbols that name the type of operation or calculation to be performed. Spreadsheets when we create a formula using an expression in a spreadsheet start the formula with an equal sign.The operators we'ill use to complete formulas are addition(+), Subtraction(-), Multiplication(*), division(/).
  
  + Cell reference: A cell reference is the single cell or range of cells in a worksheet that can be used in a formula.Cell references contain the letter of the column and the number of the row where the data is. 
  
  + Range: A range of cells is a collection of two or more cells. A range can include cells from the same row or column or from different columns and rows collected together.

Formulas are a great way to become more efficient when using spreadsheets especially when you add shortcuts like copying and pasting into the mix.
  
  + Functions: Functions while they're closely related to formulas they're not exactly the same. 
   *A function is a preset command that automatically performs a specific process or task using the data.* 
   Lot of spreadsheet functions have names that tell you what they do like Sum, Average, Count, Min, Max and So on. The great things about functions is they don't always need operators like a plus sign for addition. Just like the formula, functions can be copied and pasted into other cells in the same column. Different functions perform different calculations but they work in the same way and not every calculation we come across has its own function to help us.

**Find the scope of the problem:**

Its always very important to _define_ the problem before trying to _solve_ them. Data Analyst have a tendency to start data analysis before realizing they are either solving the wrong problem or they don't have the right data. So its very important to develop a structured approach to defining the problem domain,this is important because if we define the problem clearly from the start it'll be easier to solve, which saves a lot of time, money and resources. 

Problem Domain: The specific area of analysis that encompasses every activity affecting or affected by the problem before we can do anything else we need to understand the problem domain and all of its parts and relationships. Data analysts aren't always giving the complete picture at the start of a project, a big part of their job is to develop a structured approach and use critical thinking to find the best solution and that starts with understanding the problem domain this is where structure thinking comes into play. To successfully solve a problem as a data analyst we need to train our brain to think structurally. 

**Time Saving with Structured Thinking:**

Carefully defining a business problem can ultimately save, time, money and resources all of this is achieved through structure thinking.
**Structure thinking** is the process of recognizing the current problem or situation, organizing available information, revealing gaps, opportunities and identifying the options.
