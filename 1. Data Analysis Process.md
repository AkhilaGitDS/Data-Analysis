    **1. Data Requirements:-**
      The Data Requirements analysis process engage a top-down approach that highlight business-driven needs, so the analysis is conducted to ensure the identified requirements are relevant and practical. 
      
     **2. Data Collection:-**
      Data collection is a systematic process of gathering observations or measurements. Either we are performing analysis for business, governmental or academic purposes, data collection allows us to gain initial knowledge and original insights into our analytical problem.
      
     **3. Data Processing:-**
      Data, when initially obtained, must be processed or organized for analysis. Data processing is the collecting and manipulation of data into the usable and desired form. The manipulation is nothing but processing, which is carried either manually or automatically in a predefined sequence of operations.
      
      **4. Data Cleaning:-**
      Data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset. Common tasks include record matching, identifying inaccuracy of data, overall quality of existing data, deduplication, and column segmentation.
      
      **5. Exploratory data analysis:-**
      Once the datasets are cleaned, it can then be analyzed. Analysts may apply a variety of techniques, referred to as exploratory data analysis, to begin understanding the messages contained within the obtained data. The process of data exploration may result in additional data cleaning or additional requests for data.
      
      **6. Modeling and algorithms:-**
      Mathematical formulas or models (known as algorithms), may be applied to the data in order to identify relationships among the variables. A model is what we build by using the algorithm which is a set of rules to follow to solve a problem.
      
      **7. Data product:-**
      A data product, in general terms, is any tool or application that processes data and generates results. Businesses can use the results of such data analysis to obtain useful information like churn prediction and customer segmentation, and use these results to make smarter decisions. 
      
      **8. Communication:-**
      Once the data are analyzed, it may be reported in many formats to the users of the analysis to support their requirements. The users may have feedback, which results in additional analysis.
