Data is a powerful tool for decision making. The more data we have, the bigger the problems we can solve and the more powerful our solutions can be but responsibly gathering data is only part of the process. we also have to turn data into knowledge that helps us make better solutions.

When it comes to decision making, data is key. There are two kinds of data, Data Quantitaive and Data Qualitative. 

**Quantitative** data is all about the specific and objective measures of numerical facts. This can frequently be : 
  the What ?, 
  How many ?,
  How often ? about problem.
  Eg: How many commuters take the train to work every week?
  
**Qualitative** data describes subjective or explanatory measures of qualities and characteristics or things that can't be measured with numerical data like our hair color. 

With quantitative data, we can see numbers visualized as charts or graphs whereas qualitative data can then give us a more high-level understanding of why the numbers are the way they are this is important because it helps us add context to a problem.

As a data analyst we'll be using both Quantitative and Qualitative analysis depending on our business requirement.

Data is great but if we can't communicate the story data is telling then it isn't useful to anyone, so we need ways to organize data that helps us turn it into information. There are all kinds of tools out there to help us visualize and share our data analysis with stakeholders. There are two different kinds of presentation tools **Reports** and **Dashboards**, which are used as data visualization tools but there are pros and cons for each of them.

A Report is a static collection of data given to stakeholders periodically. A Dashboard on the other hand monitors live incoming data.

   **Reports: **
         
         Pros:
         + High-level historical data.
         + Easy to use as long as we continually mnaintain them.
         + Precleaned and sorted data.
         Cons:
         + Continual maintenance.
         + Static.
         + Less Visually appealing.
