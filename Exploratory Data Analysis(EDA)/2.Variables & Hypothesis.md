Start with stating the exploration question, the purpose of the exploration, the resources needed, and a plan for the exploration, including a model of the situation under study. 

Where do exploration ideas come from?  Need for deciding or acting; job; Curiosity; experience; etc.

A model shows how different elements are linked by relationships.  The elements for a model can be drawn from personal experience, consulting with key players, asking experts and  existing data sets and so on.  Generally a model is fixed at the beginning of the investigation; it may be altered as a result of the data analysis.

A model is a visual representation of how something works; it both describes and explains some phenomenon.
