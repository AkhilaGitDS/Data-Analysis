**How do data analysts bring data to life?**

Well, it starts with the right data analysis tools. These include spreadsheets, databases, query languages, and visualization software. 
*The data analysis process phases are ask, prepare, process, analyze, share and act.*

**Understanding Data Life Cycle:**

When we think about a life cycle, what's the first thing that comes to mind - for me its butterfly lifecycle. 
Butterflies begin as eggs, hatch into caterpillars and then become a chrysalis that's where the real magic happens. 
Data has a life cycle of its own too. 
  
  **The Data LifeCycle and its phases:**
      Let's dig in each of the phases in Data Life Cycle which makes us understand, the individual phases data goes through the life cycle.
      
   Life Cycle of data is **plan -> capture -> manage -> analyze -> archive -> destroy.**
   
   **Plan:-** Planning actually happens well before starting an analysis project. During planning a business decides what kind of data it needs, how it will be managed throughout its life cycle, who will be responsible for it and the optimal outcomes.
   For example, let's say an electricity provider wanted to gain insights into how to save people energy, in the planning phase they might decide to capture information on how much electricity its customers use each year, what types of buildings are being powered and what types of devices are being powered inside of them. The electricity company would also decide which team members will be responsible for collecting storing and sharing that data. All of this happens during planning and it helps set up the rest of the project.
   
   **Capture:-** This is where data is collected from a variety of different sources and brought into the organization with so much data being created every day. The ways to collect it are truly endless, one common method is getting data from outside resources.
   For example, if we're doing data analysis on weather patterns, we'd probably get data from a publicly available data set like the national climatic data center another way to get data is from a company's own documents and files which are usually stored inside a database. A database is a collection of data stored in a computer system.
   
   *Note: when we capture and maintain a database of customer information ensuring data integrity, credibility and privacy are all important concerns.*
   
   **Manage:-** Here we're talking about how we care for our data, how and where it's stored. the tools used to keep it safe and secure and the actions taken to make sure that it's maintained properly. Data Cleansing is very important in this phase. 
   
   **Analyze:-** This is where data analysts really shine by using data to solve problems, make great decisions and support business goals .
   
   **Archive:-** Archiving means storing data in a place where it's still available but may not be used again. During analysis analysts handle huge amounts of data. if we had to sort through all of the available data that's out there even if it was no longer useful and relevant to our work it makes way more sense to archive it than to keep it around.
   
   **Destroy:-** Yes it sounds sad but when we destroy data it won't hurt a bit. It's always a better practice to destroy data which is stored on multiple hard drives or shred the paper files, for protecting a company's private information as well as private data about its customers. 
   
Till now that we understood all the **phases of the Data life cycle**, it's time to move on to the **phases of Data Analysis.** they sound similar but are two different.
Data analysis isn't a life cycle it's the process of analyzing data. Lets see each step of the data analysis process and how it will relate to our work as a data analyst.

**Steps of Data Analysis:-**

 **Step 1:** In **ASK** phase, we do 2 things: We define problem to be solved and we make sure that we fully understand stakeholder expectations. Stakeholders hold a stake in the project, they are people who have invested time and resources into a project and are interested in the outcome.
