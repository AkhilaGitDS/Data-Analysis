Across industries like finance, marketing, technology, healthcare and so many more real companies are already using data analytics to stay ahead of the race and the more they use data in their business the more they understand, just how important data analysts like us to their success. 

**Real-life example:** Coco-cola, we likely recognize the brand. Data is changing the way coca-cola approaches its marketing strategies. Coco-cola uses data gathered from consumer feedback to create advertising, that speaks directly to different audiences with different interests. Lets see how this works, we know those high-tech coca-cola vending machines we see at movie theater sometimes it's always fun getting to make our own flavors. Those machines have built-in artificial intelligence and data analysis tools which helps coca-cola see all the different kinds of flavor combinations people are coming up with which they can then use as motivation for new products.

Not only big brand companies are using data, small businesses everywhere are also starting to take advantage of data driven insights to improve their operations and make better decisions. Small businesses can use data to do all kinds of things they might use data analytics to better understand their customers buying habits create more effective social media messaging or in the case of one city zoo and aquarium predict the number of daily visitors based on local climate data.

City zoo and aquarium realized that on rainy days they were seeing huge drop-offs in attendance, but they had no way to accurately predict when those rainy days would hit. This made staffing a real challenge. Some days they found themselves overstaffed other days they were unprepared for the rush of visitors. To deal with this, data analysts took years of weather records from the zoo and used that data to accurately predict future weather patterns. This made it easy for the zoo to know how much staff they needed when. Because the zoo could predict and manage their staffing needs more accurately they were able to provide a better experience for visitors and dedicate more resources to creating a better experience for the animals too.

There are many ways that companies in different industries put data to use, but they can only do that if they have data analysts they can rely on. A common theme across every business is they all have issues to explore questions to answer or problems to solve. When we talk about data analytics, 
an **Issue** is a topic or subject to investigate, a **Question** is designed to discover information and a **Problem** is an obstacle or complication that needs to be worked out.

As a data analyst, we'll be tackling business tasks that help companies use data. A business task is the question or problem data analysis answers for business. Analyze weather data from the last decade to identify predictable patterns. The data analysts could then plan out the best way to gather, analyze and present the data needed to solve this business task. 

Data driven decision making is when facts that have been discovered through data analysis are used to guide business strategy. The simplest way to think about decision making is that it's a choice between consequences good, bad or a combination of both in our zoo example.
