**How do data analysts bring data to life?**

Well, it starts with the right data analysis tools. These include spreadsheets, databases, query languages, and visualization software. 
*The data analysis process phases are ask, prepare, process, analyze, share and act.*

**Understanding Data Life Cycle:**

When we think about a life cycle, what's the first thing that comes to mind - for me its butterfly lifecycle. 
Butterflies begin as eggs, hatch into caterpillars and then become a chrysalis that's where the real magic happens. 
Data has a life cycle of its own too. 
  
  **The Data LifeCycle and its phases:**
      Let's dig in each of the phases in Data Life Cycle which makes us understand, the individual phases data goes through the life cycle.
      
   Life Cycle of data is **plan -> capture -> manage -> analyze -> archive -> destroy.**
   
   **Plan:-** Planning actually happens well before starting an analysis project. During planning a business decides what kind of data it needs, how it will be managed throughout its life cycle, who will be responsible for it and the optimal outcomes.
   For example, let's say an electricity provider wanted to gain insights into how to save people energy, in the planning phase they might decide to capture information on how much electricity its customers use each year, what types of buildings are being powered and what types of devices are being powered inside of them. The electricity company would also decide which team members will be responsible for collecting storing and sharing that data. All of this happens during planning and it helps set up the rest of the project.
   
   **Capture:-** This is where data is collected from a variety of different sources and brought into the organization with so much data being created every day. The ways to collect it are truly endless, one common method is getting data from outside resources.
   For example, if we're doing data analysis on weather patterns, we'd probably get data from a publicly available data set like the national climatic data center another way to get data is from a company's own documents and files which are usually stored inside a database. A database is a collection of data stored in a computer system.
   
   *Note: when we capture and maintain a database of customer information ensuring data integrity, credibility and privacy are all important concerns.*
   
   **Manage:-** Here we're talking about how we care for our data, how and where it's stored. the tools used to keep it safe and secure and the actions taken to make sure that it's maintained properly. Data Cleansing is very important in this phase. 
   
   **Analyze:-** This is where data analysts really shine by using data to solve problems, make great decisions and support business goals .
   
   **Archive:-** Archiving means storing data in a place where it's still available but may not be used again. During analysis analysts handle huge amounts of data. if we had to sort through all of the available data that's out there even if it was no longer useful and relevant to our work it makes way more sense to archive it than to keep it around.
   
   **Destroy:-** Yes it sounds sad but when we destroy data it won't hurt a bit. It's always a better practice to destroy data which is stored on multiple hard drives or shred the paper files, for protecting a company's private information as well as private data about its customers. 
   
Till now that we understood all the **phases of the Data life cycle**, it's time to move on to the **phases of Data Analysis.** they sound similar but are two different.
Data analysis isn't a life cycle it's the process of analyzing data. Lets see each step of the data analysis process and how it will relate to our work as a data analyst.

**Steps of Data Analysis:-**

 **Step 1: Ask ::** In Ask phase, we do 2 things: We *define problem* to be solved and we make sure that we fully _understand stakeholder expectations_. 
 
 Stakeholders hold a support in the project, they are people who have invested time and resources into a project and are interested in the outcome. 
 
 *Defining a problem* means we look at the current state and identify how it's different from the ideal state, usually there's an obstacle we need to get rid of or something wrong that needs to be fixed. 
For instance, a cricket match might want to reduce the time fans spend waiting in the ticket line, the obstacle is figuring out how to get the viewers to their seats more quickly.

  Another main point is to is *understanding stakeholder expectations*, first step here is to discover who the stakeholders are - which may include our manager or an executive sponsor or our sales partners, there can be lots of stakeholders, but what they all have in common is that they help make decisions, influence actions and strategies and have specific goals they want to meet. They also care about project and that's why it's so important to understand their expectations. 
  For instance, if our manager assigns us a data analysis project related to business risk, it would be smart to confirm whether they want to include all types of risks that could affect the company or just risks related to weather such as hurricanes and tornadoes. Communicating with our stakeholders is key in making sure we stay engaged and on track throughout the project. The ask phase helps data analyst keep focused on the problem itself not just its symptoms.
  
**Step 2: Prepare ::** This is the step where data analysts collect and store which they'll use that data for the upcoming analysis process. We'll learn more about the different types of data and how to identify which kinds of data are most useful for solving a particular problem. We'll also discover why it's so important that our data and results are objective and unbiased. _Any decisions made from our analysis should always be based on facts and be fair and impartial._

**Step 3: Process ::** Here data analysts _find and remove any errors and inaccuracies_ that can get in the way of results. This generally means cleaning data, transforming it into more useful format, combining two or more data sets to make information more complete and removing outliers which are any data points that could skew the information. 
After that we'll check the data we prepared to make sure it's complete and correct. This phase is all about getting the details right so we'll also fix typos, inconsistencies or missing in inaccurate data and to top it off we'll gain strategies for verifying and sharing our data cleansing with stakeholders.

**Step 4: Analyze ::** Analyzing the data we've collected involves using tools to transform and organize that information, so that we can draw useful conclusions, make predictions and drive informed decision making. There are lots of powerful tools data analysts use in their work. Here we'll learn about two of the basic tools spreadsheets and structure query language (sql).

**Step 5: Share ::**  We'll learn how data analysts _simplify results and share them with others to help stakeholders make effective data-driven decisions_. In this phase visualization is a data analyst's best friend, that highlight why visualization is essential to getting others to understand what our data is telling us with the right visuals. Facts and figures become so much easier to see and complex concepts become easier to understand. R and Python(Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib so on) are popular tool for data manipulation, calculation, and visualization.

**Step 6: Act ::** This is the thrilling moment when the business takes all of the insights we the data analysts have provided and puts them to work in order to solve the original business problem and will be acting on what we've learned based on above steps.

**Some of the common Data Analysis tools used on daily basis are:**
+ Spreadsheets
+ Query languages for databases
+ Visualization tools

_Once we've learned the power of the above tools we will be well on our way to becoming the best data analyst we can possibly be._

**1. Spreadsheets:** There are lots of different spreadsheet solutions but two popular options are _microsoft excel and google sheets_. To put it straightforwardly, a spreadsheet is a digital worksheet it stores, organizes and sorts data. This is important because, the usefulness of our data depends on how well it's structured. When we put our data into a spreadsheet we can see patterns, group informations and easily find the information we need. Spreadsheets also have some really useful features called _formulas and functions_.

  _A Formula_ is a set of instructions that performs a specific calculation using the data in a spreadsheet. Formulas can do basic things like add, subtract, multiply and divide but they don't stop there we can also use formulas to find the average of a number set, look up a particular value, return the sum of a set of values that meets a particular rule and so on.

  _A Function_ is a preset command that automatically performs a specific process or task using the data in the spreadsheet. Just think of a function as a simpler more efficient way of doing something that would normally take a lot of time. 
  
  **2. Query languages for databases:** A query language is a computer programming language that allows us to retrieve and manipulate data from a database. We'll learn something called structured query language(SQL). SQL is a language that lets data analysts communicate with a database. A database is a collection of data stored in a computer system. SQL is the most widely used structured query language for a couple of reasons: it's easy to understand and works very well with all kinds of databases. With sql, data analysts can access the data they need by making the query, although query means question. Query is more of a request, we are requesting the database do something for us. We can ask it to do a lot of different things such as insert, delete, select or update data - that's a top-level look at sql.
  
  **3. Visualization tools:** We've learned that data visualization is the graphical representation of information some examples include graphs, maps and tables. Most people process visuals more easily than words alone that's why visualizations are so important. They help data analysts communicate their insights to others in an effective and compelling way. When we think about the data analysis process, after data is prepared, processed and analyzed the insights are visualized. So it can be understood and shared
this makes it easier for stakeholders to draw conclusions, make decisions and come up with strategies. some popular _visualization tools are Tableau and Looker_ . Data analysts like using tableau because it helps them create visuals that are very easy to understand this means that even non-technical users can get the information they need. Looker is also popular with data analysts because it gives them an easy way to create visuals based on the results of a query. With Looker, we can give stakeholders a complete picture of our work by showing them visualization data and the actual data related to it. All visualization tools have great features that are useful in different situations. Soon we'll learn how to decide which tool to use for a particular task.
