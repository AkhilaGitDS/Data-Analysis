**Stakeholder: **

Stakeholders play important role with Data Analysts. Stakeholders are people that have invested time, interest and resources into the projects that we'll be working on as a data analyst. In other words they hold stakes in what we're doing, there's a good chance they'll need the work from us to perform their own needs that's why it's so important to makesure our work lines up with their needs and why we need to communicate effectively with all of the stakeholders.
