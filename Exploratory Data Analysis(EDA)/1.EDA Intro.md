The EDA approach is exactly about how a data analysis should be carried out. It is a philosophy as to how we divide a data set; what we look for; how we look; and how we clarify.
EDA uses various methods to:
  + ;
  + Extract major variables;
  + Identify outliers and anomalies;
  + Reveal underlying structure and test underlying beliefs;

Majority of EDA techniques are graphical/ pictorial in nature. The main role of EDA is to open-mindedly explore, and graphics gives the analysts unique power to do so by convincing the data to reveal its structural secret, and being always ready to gain some new, often simple insight into the data.

**Data Analysis Approaches:**

Three popular data analysis approaches are:
- Classical
- Exploratory (EDA)
- Bayesian

The above 3 approaches are similar that they all start with general science/engineering issues and all in turn give science/engineering conclusions. The difference is the order and focus of the intermediate steps.

- For classical analysis, the order is;
  Issue => Data => Model => Analysis => Conclusions
  
- For Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA), the order is;
  Issue => Data => Analysis => Model => Conclusions

- For Bayesian, the order is;
  Issue => Data => Model => Prior Distribution => Analysis => Conclusions
  
In the reality, data analysts easily combine elements of all of the above three approaches (and other approaches). 

The Exploratory Data Analysis approach does not force deterministic(must happen) or probabilistic(May or may not happen) models on the data. On the contrary, the EDA approach allows the data to suggest admissible models that best fit the data and its always focus is on the data--its structure, outliers, and models suggested by the data. EDA techniques are generally graphical. They include mean plots, scatter plots, box plots, character plots, histograms, probability plots, bihistograms, and residual plots.

EDA makes use of and present all of the available data and there is no corresponding loss of information with little or no assumption.
