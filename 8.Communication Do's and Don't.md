**Stakeholders: **

Stakeholders play important role with Data Analysts. Stakeholders are people that have invested time, interest and resources into the projects that we'll be working on as a data analyst. In other words they hold stakes in what we're doing, there's a good chance they'll need the work from us to perform their own needs that's why it's so important to makesure our work lines up with their needs and why we need to communicate effectively with all of the stakeholders across the team. 

Project Managers are in charge of planning and executing a project, part of the project manager's job is keeping the project on track and look after the progress of the entire team. In most cases we'll need to give them regular updates, let them know what we need to succeed and tell them if we have any problems along the way, we might also be working with other team members. 

Our fellow data analysts will need all our focus and communication to carry the project to success. Focusing on stakeholder expectations will help us understand the goal of a project. Should Communicate more effectively across our team and build trust in our work. 

**Focus on what matters:**

By asking ourself a few simple questions at the beginning of each task we can ensure that we're able to stay focused on our objective while still balancing stakeholder needs.
