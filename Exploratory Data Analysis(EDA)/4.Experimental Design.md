In an experiment, we knowingly change one or more process variables (or factors/independent variable) in order to observe the effect the changes have on one or more response variables(dependent variable). 

_Process variable_ that stands alone and isn't changed by the other variables we are trying to measure. Eg: 'Age' might be independent variable.

_Response variable_ is exactly what it sounds like, something that depends on other factors. Eg: 'Test Score' will depend on how much we studied, how much sleep we had last night before test, how much hungry we are while writing test and so on. 

An Experimental Design is the laying out of a detailed experimental plan in advance of doing the experiment. Well chosen experimental designs maximize the amount of "information" that can be obtained for a given amount of experimental effort. 

The statistical theory underlying _Experimental Design_ generally begins with the concept of process models.
